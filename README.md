## Future Improvements

While the current version of the Unique Path and Shareable Link Resume Builder is functional, there are several areas where I plan to enhance and expand the project:

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user accounts and authentication to allow users to save and manage multiple resumes securely.

2. **Resume Templates**:
   - Add support for multiple resume templates to offer users more design choices.

3. **Enhanced PDF Formatting**:
   - Improve the formatting and styling of the generated PDFs for a more professional appearance.

4. **Cloud Storage Integration**:
   - Integrate with cloud storage services (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox) to allow users to save and access their resumes from anywhere.

5. **Analytics and Tracking**:
   - Include features to track resume views and downloads to provide users with insights on their resume performance.
